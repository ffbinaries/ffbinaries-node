Downloads precompiled **ffmpeg, ffprobe, ffplay and ffserver binaries**
from [ffbinaries.com](https://ffbinaries.com).

This module is cross-platform and can be used through CLI or as a Node module
(i.e. as a build step or a part of app boot routine).

You can download whatever binaries you need during the build if you'd like
to bundle the binaries with your distributable files or just download it on
user's machine during initial setup process.


# Usage

You can run it from your code or through CLI.

If `output` argument is specified the binary will be placed there.
It will default to current working directory.

If `platform` argument is missing then the current platform will be automatically
detected and binaries for it will be downloaded.

If `components` argument is missing then binaries of all available components
will be downloaded (see [Included components](#included-components) section).


## CLI

When installed globally with `npm i ffbinaries -g` this module will register
itself on command line interface.


### Arguments

CLI uses the following syntax:

`ffbinaries [components] [--platform] [--output] [--quiet] [--version]`

Each flag can also be abbreviated in your scripts with `-p`, `-o`, `-q` and `-v` respectively.

### Examples

**Download all binaries for your platform**

`ffbinaries`


**Download all binaries for a specified platform**

`ffbinaries --platform=mac`


**Download only ffplay for 64-bit Windows, quiet output**

`ffbinaries ffplay --platform=win-64 --quiet`


**Download only ffmpeg and ffprobe, version 3.2 for 64-bit Linux, quiet output, save binaries in a specified directory**

`ffbinaries ffmpeg ffprobe -p=linux-64 -q -v=3.2 -o=/usr/local/bin`


**Additional commands**

There are also `ffbinaries help`, `ffbinaries versions` and `ffbinaries clearcache`.


## Programmatically

### Methods

`ffbinaries` library exports the following methods:

* `downloadBinaries(platform, opts, callback)` downloads and extracts the requested binaries.

  The `opts` parameter is an object that can contain these optional parameters:
  * `destination`: the path where the binaries will be downloaded to. If not provided it will default to `.`.
  * `components`: an array of string values that describes which [components](#included-components) to download. If not provided it will default to all components available for the platform.
  * `version`: version of ffmpeg to download
  * `force`: ignore check for existing binaries in the destination and overwrite them if necessary
  * `quiet`: suppress verbose logs
  * `tickerFn`: a progress-update function, triggered with percentage as argument at an interval until download is completed
  * `tickerInterval`: frequency at which the ticker progress updates are issued (in ms; defaults to `1000`)

* `getVersionData(version, callback)` fetches the full data set without downloading any binaries.

* `listVersions(callback)` returns the list of available versions from the API

* `listPlatforms()` returns the list of available platforms

* `detectPlatform()` returns the platform code of the machine as detected by the module.

* `resolvePlatform(input)` resolves input to a platform code (matches aliases).

* `getBinaryFilename(component, platform)` resolves a filename of a binary
for a given platform (appends ".exe" in Windows).

* `locateBinariesSync(components, opts)` looks for binaries already existing
in the system. Returns object with located binaries, their paths and versions.

  `opts` parameter is an object that can specify these additional options:
  * `paths` to provide locations to check in first
  * `ensureExecutable` will set executable flag on the file if it's missing

* `clearCache()` purges local cache


### Examples

**Download all binaries for your platform**

```
var ffbinaries = require('ffbinaries');

ffbinaries.downloadBinaries(function () {
  console.log('Downloaded all binaries for current platform.');
});
```

*Note: you don't need to check for existence of the binaries in the destination folder. ffbinaries will check if the binaries exist first and it will not attempt to re-download them unless you specify `{force: true}`.*


**Download only ffmpeg and ffprobe, version 3.2 for 64-bit Linux, quiet output, save binaries in a specified location**

```
var ffbinaries = require('ffbinaries');
var dest = __dirname + '/binaries';

ffbinaries.downloadBinaries(['ffmpeg', 'ffprobe'], {platform: 'linux-64', quiet: true, destination: dest}, function () {
  console.log('Downloaded ffplay and ffprobe binaries for linux-64 to ' + dest + '.');
});
```
