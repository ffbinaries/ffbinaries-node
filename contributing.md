## Contribution guidelines

Your pull request will need to pass automated linting and testing
to ensure nothing breaks.
It would be greatly appreciated if the code you're submitting was unit tested too.

You can check locally if your code lints correctly and unit tests are passing
with `npm run lint` and `npm run test`.


## TODO

* global installs (place binaries in `/usr/local/bin` or `C:/ffmpeg`)
* proof-read and correct documentation where necessary
* **[help needed]** recompile all binaries (all platforms; both with and without proprietary codecs)

These are just a few items currently planned.
You don't have to restrict yourself to items on this list but you can
treat them as a suggestion - any help is appreciated.
