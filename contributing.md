## Contribution guidelines

Your pull request will need to pass automated linting and testing
to ensure existing functionality doesn't break.

It would be greatly appreciated if the code you submit was unit tested too
but it's not a requirement.

You can check locally if your code lints correctly and unit tests are passing
with `npm run lint` and `npm run test`.


## Recompiling binaries (help needed)

ffmpeg suite is notoriously difficult to compile.

I'd like to recompile all binaries for all platforms and provide versions
with and without proprietary codecs.

If you'd like to help please see the open issues in
[ffbinaries-prebuilt repo](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-prebuilt)
for more details.
