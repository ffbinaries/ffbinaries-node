# Contributing

First of all thanks for considering contributing to ffbinaries.

If you'd like to help out with feel free to create a fork of this repo
and raise a pull request.

You can see a list of people who contributed [here](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-node/graphs/contributors).


## Contribution guidelines

Your pull request will need to pass automated linting and testing
to ensure nothing breaks.
It would be greatly appreciated if the code you're submitting was unit tested too.

You can check locally if your code lints correctly and unit tests are passing
with `npm run lint` and `npm run test`.


## TODO

* allow global installs (place binaries in `/usr/local/bin` or `C:/ffmpeg`)
* proof-read and correct documentation where necessary
* **[help needed]** recompile all binaries (all platforms; both with and without proprietary codecs - see `ffbinaries-prebuilt` repo for more details)

These are just a few items currently planned.
You don't have to restrict yourself to items on this list but you can
treat them as a suggestion - any help is appreciated.
